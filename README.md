# Coursera Developing Data Products Week 4 Peer-graded Assignment: Shiny

In this project, we created a Shiny application and deployed it on RStudio's servers, and used R Presentations (also known as RStudio Presenter) to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about our application. 

The application is [published online on shinyapps.io](https://uzmamahmood.shinyapps.io/swissDataApp/).

The presentation is [published online on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/uzma/441619) and [on GitHub]()
